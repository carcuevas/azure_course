**   DON'T USE STORAGE ACCOUNT (Disk Classic) FOR PROD! so used MANAGED DISKS!!!

BLOBS
--------

	* Cloud object oriented storage (like S3 in AWS) for APP and web scale data.

	* Types:
			- Block Blobs: most object storage scneraios
			- Append blobs: multi-writer (for instance logs)
	* We have to have an Storage account, where we will have "Containers" (as folders) where we'll have our 

	* url. https://{account}.blob.core.windows.net/container/{blob_name}



Tables
---------

	* Like dyanmoDB in AWS




Queues
----------

	* Messages between API for example




Unmanaged vs Managed disks : Manage disks are faster better more reliable and more expensive :D


Cold Storage - Storage Tier like Glacier for AWS
